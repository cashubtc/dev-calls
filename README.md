# Cashu Developer Calls ðŸ¥œ

Minutes from Cashu dev calls and meetings, which are conducted under the **Chatham House rule.**

> When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule,
> participants are free to use the information received, but neither the
> identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other

Minutes will follow the rule too, and any Issues or Pull Requests to this repo are expected to do the same.

**When and Where do the calls happen? How do I join?**

Calls are arranged in the [Cashu R&D Telegram group](https://t.me/CashuBTC), the agenda links to join will be posted there.
