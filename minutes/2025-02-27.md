* [Mint communication module](https://primal.net/e/note15g2memv7s67ec6sqc9lt0jzqtlleu4ctwtxy98wlyl6nnptl965s9amnkp) - mint communication module based on cashu-ts that will make sure mint calls are properly scheduled and you are not running into issue with rate-limiting. It differentiates between priority tasks (get executed as soon as possible) and regular tasks (get executed if no priority tasks are waiting and will make sure there is enough rate left for priority tasks). It also allows scheduling polling with backoffs and timeouts.
