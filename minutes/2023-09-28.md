## 2. NUT discussions
- [x] Latest [changes to the spec](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/commits?since=2023-08-25)
  - Add test vectors for NUTs 01 & 02
  - Various typo fixes
  - Removed `cashu_wallet_spec` ðŸ«¡
- [x] NUT-10/11/12/XX - NUT PR discussion
    - [NUT-10](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/pull/50) â€“ Spending conditions
        - *Calle: I would like to give this a name like "smart ecash" or "programmable ecash" or something that sounds less lame.*
        - Change since last time: Tags can now include more than one value
    - [NUT-11](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/pull/40) â€“ P2PK
        - Change: `pubkey` Tag now `pubkeys` with support for multiple values
        - Change: `refund` Tag can now also have multiple pubkeys
    - [NUT-12](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/pull/51) â€“Â DLEQ proofs
        - *Calle: should this have a different number?*
    - [NUT-XX](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu/pull/325) â€“Â HTLCs 
        - *Not specced out yet but it should be very easy. Already merged into Nutshell but happy to change when spec emerges.*
        - How do we number the NUTs?
- [x] NUT-05 extension: Melting tokens without blocking
    - `POST /melt` returns immediately instead of waiting for the Lightning invoice to succeed.
    - `GET /check` returns two boolean tokens state vectors: `spendable` and `pending`
    - Wallets deduce Lightning payment state from token state: 
        - `in-flight if spendable & pending`
        - `success if not spendable & not pending`
        - `failed if spendable & not pending`
    - Needs discussion: to return overpaid fees with this model, the payment needs to be queried by the wallet after payment (not possible yet) and the mint needs to remember whether it issued overpaid lightning fees to the wallet (outgoing Lightning payments are still stateless) â€“ worth it?
    - POST `/restore` endpoint

## 3. Protocol discussions
- [x] Embedding tokens in animated QR codes
- [x] Standardizing errors between mint and client
    - Attempt to tackle this in Nutshell: [`cashu/core/errors.py`](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu/blob/main/cashu/core/errors.py)
- [ ] DLEQ proofs: implementation details in Nutshell 
    - Alice sharing `r` with the receiver Carol of the DLEQ proof affects token privacy if receiver and the mint collude (or the DLEQ proof is publicly posted, as in nostr)
    - Summary of the problem and discussion with Waxwing in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/callebtc/06da2621d48212af871bee8d5be11953)
    - Wallets MUST mint a fresh token (with `POST /split`) before posting it online so that we can ensure unlinkability between Lightning payments and ecash with DLEQ proofs
- [x] Discussion on size of secrets ([#44](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/issues/44))
	- Is there a reason to allow different "simple secrets" sizes? (ability to create them from human-readable strings maybe? backwards-compatibility?).
	- If the default had been that all secrets needed to be exactly 32 bytes long or a string of "x" number of characters long, would we consider changing them to allow for _any_ size?
- [x] Backwards compatibility (how are we currently thinking about this?)
- [x] Communications between user/mint about accepted secret types
