#### Number of proofs for payments between 1 sat - 1M sats
Research by TB:

If you are willing to overpay by up to 16 satoshis

**On Token Size**

*Tokens V3 are mostly comprised of proofs with a bit of metadata (mint url, unit, memo). A single proof is a data structure a little over 81 bytes long (amount (8 bytes), id (8 bytes), secret (32 bytes), C (33 bytes) plus the fields' names). Using CBOR encoding, we can fit proofs into a little under 100 bytes, and together with the metadata, we can think of a 5-proof token as being 500 bytes.*

*Note that the above is only if we encode the tokens using CBOR, which is much smaller than the base64 we have in the spec; the tokens grow about 50% in size if you use our normal base64 encoding.*

# Spam prevention
- Rough guide: Cost of producing 1M mint database entriees should be around $1k
- Right now using the `/swap` endpoint is free. `/melt` and `/mint` incurr Lightning fees. 
- Note: Internal `melt-mint` transactions with zero fee also produce cost
- Mint database entries: inputs (proofs) and outputs (blind messages)
- Therefore, **cost** is proportional to number of inputs + outputs
- How to minimize **cost**?
- Three ideas: Fees, PoW, Auth
- ![three paths](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyfF-7Cn6.jpg)

## PoW
Idea: Add PoW to every input and output. The mint can decide the difficulty. We ran tests: Javascript in Browser around 30x slower than Python (on comparable Macs). Rust is probably another 100x faster. 

*There is no middle ground between an attacker with a good machine and bearable mobile UX with JavaScript*

## Auth
Idea: Have new `/auth` endpoint that can issue "access tokens". 

Discussion [Fedimint](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/discussions/1440#discussioncomment-8521158)

These can be blinded like ecash. If they are blinded, they need a double-spend check and require a new database. 

Under which condition should these be issued? For example for a fee, for PoW, or for solving a Captcha. 

## Fees

Idea: `inputs - outputs >= fee`. 

**Pros:** 
- Is *very* easy to implement (~10 lines of code)
- Does not need an additional database (like auth tokens)
- Do not need another endpoint.

**Cons:**
- Fees don't feel great.
- Fee rate must be communicated from the mint to wallet
- Lowest fee is the lowest denomination (1 sat, 1 msat, 1 cent)
- Needs smarter coin control: avoid accumulating Dust

#### Pricing

*Constant fee* per transaction only works if the number of inputs and outputs are limited (example: 1 sat per transaction but maximum 100 inputs and outputs).

*Variable fee* per input and output 

- $1000 are around 2M sat 
- `math.ceil(max(1, nr_of_elements/10))`
